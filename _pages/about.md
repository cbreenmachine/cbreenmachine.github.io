I am a statistician and computational biologist working on methods for DNA methylation analysis. I'm a third-year PhD student in the [statistics department](https://stat.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison. I'm advised by [Sündüz Keleş](http://www.sunduzkeles.org/) and [Reid Alisch](https://www.neurosurgery.wisc.edu/research/alisch/). Since August 2021 I've been fortunate to be a trainee in the [Computationa and Informatics in Biology and Medicine](https://cibm.wisc.edu/) program.
