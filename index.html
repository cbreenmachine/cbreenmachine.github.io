<p>I am an AI Resident at <a href="https://x.company/" target="_blank">X, the moonshot factory</a> (fka Google[x]). At X, I work on modeling plant genetic data with a blend of neural networks and classical statistical models.</p>
   
<p>
   I am working on my Statistics PhD at UW Madison advised by Sunduz Keles. I work on modeling large-scale genetic and epigenetic data using both statistical and neural network models.

<h3>Statistical Consulting</h3>
My favorite part of data science is doing full-stack statistical analysis: working with a client in identifying/refining hypotheses, fitting/evaluating models, and building a narrative to tie it all together. A couple of representative reports are found below.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="docs/ColdHardiness.html">Quantifying the cold hardiness of trees in the American Northeast</a></strong>. 
   <ul>
      <li>30,000 ft view plots made the problem much easier to understand</li>
      <li>Data quality control was critical (small labeling errors in the raw data would have caused problems) </li>
      <li>Mixed-effects models are great in this context</li>
   </ul>
<li><strong><a href="docs/ExoplanetTransit.html">Assessing evidence of an exoplanet transit</a></strong>
   <ul>
      <li>Clean visualizations made the problem setup pop</li>
      <li>Simple (Gaussian mixture) models provided the perfect amount of interpretability</li>
      <li>Interpretation was critical!</li>
   </ul>

   <li><strong><a href="docs/FoliarTraits.html">Comparing two modeling paradigms to map hyperspectral imaging data to foliar traits </a></strong>
      <ul>
         <li>Comparing Partial Least Squares and Bayesian Spike-and-slab regression</li>
         <li>Using hyperspectral imaging data as input and foliar traits (e.g. chemical composition) as output</li>
         <li>Feature selection facilitates interpretability</li>
      </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Software engineering</h3>
Code written while at X
   - Inheritance
   - Decorators
   - Plots as unit tests

Deliberate effor to write clean software and workflows. A representative example of well-documented software is here:

A couple of workflows in R targets and Snakemake are here.
