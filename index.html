<p>I am an AI Resident at <a href="https://x.company/" target="_blank">X, the moonshot factory</a> (fka Google[x]). At X, I work on modeling plant genetic data with a blend of neural networks and classical statistical models.</p>
   
<p>
   I am working on my Statistics PhD at UW Madison advised by Sunduz Keles. I work on modeling large-scale genetic and epigenetic data using both statistical and neural network models.

<h2>Statistical Consulting</h2>
The best part of working with data is doing full-stack statistical analysis: working with a client in identifying/refining hypotheses, fitting/evaluating models, and building a narrative to tie it all together. A couple of representative reports are found below.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="docs/ColdHardiness.html">Quantifying the cold hardiness of trees in the American Northeast</a></strong>. 
   <ul>
      <li>30,000 ft view plots made the problem much easier to understand</li>
      <li>Data quality control was critical (small labeling errors in the raw data would have caused problems) </li>
      <li>Mixed-effects models are great in this context</li>
   </ul>
<li><strong><a href="docs/ExoplanetTransit.html">Assessing evidence of an exoplanet transit</a></strong>
   <ul>
      <li>Clean visualizations made the problem setup pop</li>
      <li>Simple (Gaussian mixture) models provided the perfect amount of interpretability</li>
      <li>Interpretation was critical!</li>
   </ul>
